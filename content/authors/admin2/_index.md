## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in) at [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in) (IITB). I am fortunate to be advised by the amazing Prof. [Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/). Prior to this, I completed my Master's (2020-23) degree from IITB under the guidance of Prof. [Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/) and Prof. [Sriram Ganapathy](http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/) where I worked on improving ASR architectures in the presence of accent information. 

My interests mainly lie in exploring **architectural innovations** and **interventions** for the ASR models. Previously, I also interned at [Sony Research](https://www.sonyresearchindia.com/) (2023-24) where I worked on integrating speech foundation models to improve downstream ASR systems.
