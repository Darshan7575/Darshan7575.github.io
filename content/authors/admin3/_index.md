## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in) at [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay(IITB)](https://www.iitb.ac.in). I am fortunate to be adviced by the amazing Prof. [Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/). Prior to this, I completed my master's(2020-23) degree from IITB under the guidance of Prof. [Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/) and Prof. [Sriram Ganapathy](http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/) where my thesis was on improving ASR architectures in presence of accent information. 

My interests mainly lie in exploring **architectural innovations** and **interventions** to improve the performance of ASR models. Previously, I also interned at [Sony Research](https://www.sonyresearchindia.com/) (2023-24) where I worked on utilizing speech foundation models to improve downstream ASR systems.
